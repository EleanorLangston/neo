## Searching

Searching in Neo is as simple as typing in the name or address of the building that you&#39;re looking for- either hitting Enter or clicking search will work, and Neo can be added as a custom search engine (See [Adding Janus As A Search Engine](https://rocketfiber.slab.com/posts/7sicdpiu)). The url for neo is as follows: `http://100.127.242.59/?search=%s`. Neo will match partial matches such as Griswold St and Ambergris Blvd for &quot;gris&quot;.

## Building Listings

Each building listing displays data in the same format:



The first column shows the building name, their business hours, the length of time each job should take, then the number of techs. As necessary, the following information will also be displayed: the ActivE switch used for the building, notes regarding the media panel, and any other notes.

Below this information is the badge panel: this panel lists 4 possible badges: one will display the unit type (MDU, MDU-SA, or SFU), and then as applicable the following are listed: Bulk Deal, ActivE, and Media Panel.

The second column is dedicated to addresses, grouped by street name. Clicking on the street name will expand all addresses in the group, and clicking it again will hide them.

## Making Changes

Clicking &quot;Update&quot; or &quot;Create&quot; will bring up the update menu. To add a badge and its corresponding field, click the inactive badge. Clicking an active badge will remove it and its corresponding field. Clicking the unit type badge (here &quot;MDU&quot;) will cycle through the three unit types: MDU, MDU-SA, and SFU. **When adding a media panel, be sure to note its relative location in each unit for support purposes.**

To add an address, click the &quot;Add Address&quot; button, then fill out the field that appears below. You do not have to hit &quot;Add Address&quot; again to save the new address- that will be done automatically when you hit the save button. **At the time of this writing, Neo is only intended for buildings in Detroit. Do not add the city to the end of the address, as it may cause unexpected behavior such as multiple duplicate addresses.**  A future update will add a city badge in the event that Cleveland or Milwaukee buildings need to be added to Neo.

To modify or delete an existing address, expand the street name of the address you wish to edit, and simply change the text. The new value will be saved accordingly, and blank text boxes will be deleted.

**Building name, hours, job length and techs needed are mandatory, as well as at least one address. If you fail to meet these requirements, your changes will not be saved.**

## Accessing Neo

Neo is temporarily hosted on a personal laptop- availability may be limited until an actual hosting solution is implemented.
